# Machine Learning Portfolio

This is a compilation of my research and work in machine learning. The purpose is to showcase the subject matter expertise and software development skills that I have.

## Algorithms

1. LogisticRegression
2. KNeighborsClassifier
3. DecisionTreeClassifier
4. RandomForestClassifier
5. lightgbm
6. xgboost 
7. Feed forward Binary Classifier for Account Closure in Keras
8. ConvNet for handwritten Diget Classification in Keras (MNIST data set)
9. LSTM for Predicting Text in Keras
10. Non Negative Matrix Factorization for Topic Modeling



## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Setup instructions

### On your machine

With Anaconda:

```
conda install --file requirements.txt -c conda-forge
```

With pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Running

```
jupyter notebook
```
